        <h1><span style="color: #edac51">Inspiration</span></h1>
        <p>This project was inspired from a few different games below we share what inspired us</p>
        <h4>Flappy bird</h4>
        <p>Flappy bird took the world by storm back in early 2014 after having been developed a short time before.</p>
        <p>Users from around the world became hooked trying to get through an endless array of pipes.</p>
        <p>Frustrated critics were harsh on with the games reviews but, now it will forever be a moment in gaming history.</p>

        <p>Altos beautiful procedurally generated landscape's captured the attention of many people back in 2015 when released,</p>
